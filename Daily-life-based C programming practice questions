Here’s a set of **daily-life-based C programming practice questions** focusing on the following topics:

* **Bitwise operators**
* **Shift operators**
* **`if` / `if-else` / nested `if-else`**
* **Looping statements** (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)

These problems are designed to reflect real-world scenarios, making learning more intuitive and interesting.

### 🔹 **1. Bitwise Operators – Daily Life Problem**

**Problem: Home Light Switches**

You have 8 lights in your home, each represented by a bit (1 = ON, 0 = OFF). Write a C program that:

* Turns ON light 3 and light 7.
* Toggles the state of light 5.
* Checks whether light 2 is ON or OFF.

> Use bitwise operators: `|`, `&`, `^`, `~`

### 🔹 **2. Shift Operators – Digital Clock Timer**

**Problem: Digital Clock Multiplication**

Imagine you're building a basic clock that counts seconds. To convert seconds into milliseconds (by multiplying by 1000), instead try to optimize:

* Multiply a number by 2, 4, 8 using **left shift (`<<`)**.
* Divide a number by 2, 4, 8 using **right shift (`>>`)**.

> Write a program that asks for seconds and displays the result using only shift operations.

### 🔹 **3. If Statement – Traffic Light System**

**Problem: Pedestrian Crossing**

Ask the user to input the color of a traffic light (`R`, `Y`, `G`):

* If it's Red (`R`), print: "Stop".
* If it's Yellow (`Y`), print: "Get Ready".
* If it's Green (`G`), print: "Go".

> Use simple `if` statements (no `else`).

---

### 🔹 **4. If-Else – Temperature Monitor**

**Problem: Room AC Controller**

Get the current room temperature as input.

* If it's greater than 30°C, print "Turn on AC".
* If it's 30°C or below, print "No need for AC".

> Use `if-else`.

### 🔹 **5. Nested If-Else – Bus Ticket Fare**

**Problem: Bus Fare Discount System**

Ask the user for:

* Age
* Gender

Apply discounts:

* If age < 12: 50% discount
* Else if age >= 60:

  * If female: 40% discount
  * Else: 30% discount
* Else: No discount

> Use nested `if-else`.

### 🔹 **6. For Loop – Electricity Bill**

**Problem: Monthly Electricity Calculation**

Assume you use a smart meter that records electricity usage per day for 30 days. Ask the user to enter daily usage in units (one value per day), and calculate total and average.

> Use a `for` loop to iterate over 30 days.

---

### 🔹 **7. While Loop – Password Retry**

**Problem: ATM PIN Entry**

Ask the user to enter a 4-digit PIN. Allow up to 3 attempts. If correct, print “Access granted”, otherwise print “Card blocked”.

> Use a `while` loop.

---

### 🔹 **8. Do-While Loop – Washing Machine Timer**

**Problem: Countdown Timer**

Ask the user for wash cycle time in seconds. Print a countdown from that number to 0, one per second.

> Use a `do-while` loop.

---

### 🔹 **9. Bitwise Logic – Smart Home Control**

**Problem: Sensor Alerts**

You have sensors in 4 rooms. Each bit in a 4-bit number represents if a room is occupied (1) or empty (0). Write a program that:

* Takes a 4-bit value (e.g. 0b1011).
* Counts how many rooms are occupied.

> Use bitwise AND and right shift in a loop.

---

### 🔹 **10. Combined Task – Water Purifier Status**

**Problem: Maintenance Alert System**

You have a system that:

* Uses bitwise flags to check filter health.
* Uses `if` statements to decide what to do.
* Uses a loop to monitor status for 7 days.

**Write a program that:**

* For each day, randomly sets filter status (good or bad using bits).
* If filter is bad for more than 3 days, print “Service Required”.
